% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{abstract}
Students of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Oregon State University need to have the opportunity to learn machine learning algorithms that will be useful in their careers. However, grasping the nuances of these algorithms is difficult when they are taught through their application to Biochemistry and Biophysics. One way that may facilitate this learning process is introducing these concepts through their application to something fun and simple, like college basketball statistics. This project will develop an online module where these students can select a machine learning algorithm, choose which college basketball statistics they want to train this algorithm with, and generate a NCAA March Madness bracket.

The page must be reasonably fast, responsive, and usable, it must provide statistics for the user to choose from, and it must provide these statistics as input to machine learning algorithms. Finally, the bracket must be generated and presented to the user. Each one of these necessary components has several potential technologies that could be used satisfactorily. It is the purpose of this document to identify the possible technologies and make reasoned decisions as to what technologies we will be using. The first three possible technologies were written by Alex Hoffer. These first three technologies are chiefly concerned with the usability of the service, specifically the design of the graphical user interface, the instructions that will be presented to the user, and the presentation of the machine learning bracket that is generated. In technologies 4 and 5 Jake Smith will talk about how we will obtain and store the sports statistics for easy use by our machine learning algorithms. It is our belief that in order for the tool to be effective in educating students it must be well designed and easy to understand. Chongxian Chen will be responsible for designing and implementing machine learning algorithm. Technologies 6, 7 and 8  will be discussing technology involved in designing machine learning algorithm, namely algorithm library, statistics model and cloud server for hosting the project % You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter

\subsection{Technology 1: Graphical user interface of web page}
% needed in second column of first page if using \IEEEpubid
%\IEEEpubidadjcol

\subsubsection{Options 1, 2, 3, 4}
Kivy, PyQt, PyGUI, Bootstrap. The first three options are libraries to be used with Python. The fourth is a software that provides HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks for use in web development.
\subsubsection{Goals for use in design}
The page must be visually pleasing, interactive, and usable. This tool will be used to demonstrate machine learning processes to programming neophytes so the logic and design of the module has to be easy to understand to ensure that the user will not be confused. 
\subsubsection{Criteria being evaluated}

Since there are not major concerns with security for this module because of the lack of sensitive information being used, security is not an important criterion. Cost is also not a very crucial factor because there are plenty of free technologies available that can generate visually pleasing and usable web pages. Availability is an important factor because we want the module to work the same on all major browsers, specifically Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. Speed is also a valuable consideration because we want the machine learning component of this service to be quick. Therefore, the technology that we use to design the web page itself should be reasonably economical so the page loads quickly and doesn’t absorb too many resources that should be allocated for the machine learning processes. Readability is also important- we would like the technology to be easy to understand. Of similar importance as speed is economy. We want this technology to be able to do a lot with only a few lines of code.
\subsubsection{Table comparing options}
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{||c c c c c c||} 
 \hline
 Technology & Economy & Readability & Availability & Speed & Notes \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 Kivy & Extremely & Extremely & Cross-platform & Very fast, built on OpenGL ES 2 & Focus is on complex UIs \\ 
 \hline
 PyQt & Extremely & Somewhat & Cross-platform & Fast, written in C++ & Focus is on mobile development \\
 \hline
 PyGUI & Extremely & Extremely & Cross-platform & Not conclusive & Smallest and simplest \\ [1ex]
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Discussion}
Each of these three technologies are viable options. Since they are all Python libraries, they should be easy to learn, 
which is important because the GUI is the first thing to be developed in our project and the other requirements build from it. 
Each of the three are powerful enough for our purposes, and each have different strengths. Kivy is sophisticated and elegant, 
but it might be too vast for our uses. Kivy is used in complex operations like touch screen animation [1], and our project doesn't call for an 
extremely sophisticated GUI. In fact, our GUI should be simple and unobtrusive so as not to draw attention away from the machine learning components. 
PyQt's strength appears to be in mobile development [2]. Since our module doesn't have to be usable from a mobile device, it may be best to go with
 a technology with a focus in computer based web development. This brings us to PyGUI, which is the best of the three options for our purposes. 
 PyGUI is the oldest of the three and was developed to be simple to implement [2]. Its focus matches with ours: we need a simple GUI, and PyGUI is the 
 least flashy and most reasonable of these technologies.
\subsubsection{Selection of best option}
PyGUI is the technology that seems to most closely capture the needs of our GUI without adding fancy features that may slow our module down and make maintenance and testing difficult.


\subsection{Technology 2: Instructions for the user to interact with the module before the module itself is presented}
% needed in second column of first page if using \IEEEpubid
%\IEEEpubidadjcol

\subsubsection{Options 1, 2, and 3}
Webix, UKI, MochaUI. All three options are freely available JavaScript libraries. Use of JavaScript is important here because we want the instructions to seamlessly lead into the module itself without requiring the user to refresh the page.
\subsubsection{Goals for use in design}
The module must have instructions for the user to follow so they can effectively use the tool. These instructions should be easy to read and flow seamlessly into the tool. The machine learning component of this project should be the central focus, and so the instructions that we provide to the user have to be designed in such a way that they are not visually offensive or disorganized.
\subsubsection{Criteria being evaluated}
Security is again not particularly important due to the innocuousness of the data being transferred from user to server. Cost is not concerning because of the wide availability of open source technologies that can properly satisfy this requirement. Speed is important because we want our server's processing resources to be saved for the machine learning algorithms and we want the page to be quick. Availability is important because we want this tool to be usable on each of the major browsers. Readability and economy are also important.
\subsubsection{Table comparing options}
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{||c c c c c c||} 
 \hline
 Technology & Economy & Readability & Availability & Speed & Notes \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 Webix & Extremely & Very & Cross-platform & Not conclusive, no metrics  & Easy to learn, 128KB \\ 
 \hline
 UKI & Very & Somewhat & Cross-platform & Fast (progressive rendering) & 34 KB, meant for desktop web apps \\
 \hline
 Angular JS & Very & Below average & Cross-platform & Somewhat fast & Easy to start, hard to maintain \\ [1ex]
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Discussion}
Webix is a popular and reliable option. What makes it so attractive is how feature rich it is, its ease of use, and its readability. The example
program listed on [3] demonstrates how economical it is, too. With only several lines of code, Webix is capable of generating a clean and usable
user interface. One drawback of Webix is that it's difficult to tell how fast it is. Its documentation merely makes note that is fast, but provides no
usable metrics. It also isn't as lightweight as UKI (128 KB for Webix [3] and 34 KB for UKI [4]), 
but it is still quite small, so its size won't be slowing down the server. UKI is also a good option and its focus appears to directly parallel ours. 
It is meant for desktop applications [4], which is the medium of our project. It is also quite fast due to its progressive rendering and can
produce 30,000 tables almost instantaneously [4]. Angular JS seems to be the worst of these three options, as it is hard to learn [5] and 
 its programs grow rapidly in complexity. It may be too ambitious for the requirements of our project to learn Angular JS.
\subsubsection{Selection of best option}
Webix is the best option because it is easy to use, reliable, and offers the features that we need without slowing down the server. UKI is another good option but is harder to use. Angular JS is not necessary for our project.

\subsection{Technology 3: Presentation of the machine learned bracket that is generated by scikit}
% needed in second column of first page if using \IEEEpubid
%\IEEEpubidadjcol

\subsubsection{Options 1, 2, and 3}
TkInter, VTK, Wax. All three options are freely available Python libraries. 
\subsubsection{Goals for use in design}
The module is functionally useless without the presentation of the bracket that was generated by the machine learning algorithm. This technology must present the bracket in a way that is visually pleasing and easy to understand. 
\subsubsection{Criteria being evaluated}
Cost and security are again not important for the reasons outlined earlier. Availability is crucial because we want the bracket to appear the same in all major browsers. Speed is important too because we want the user to see their bracket promptly. Readability and economy are also useful considerations.
\subsubsection{Table comparing options}
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{||c c c c c c||} 
 \hline
 Technology & Economy & Readability & Availability & Speed & Notes \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 TkInter & Extremely & Somewhat & Cross-platform & Slow & Most popular Python GUI library \\ 
 \hline
 VTK & Extremely & Extremely & Cross-platform & Fast, written in C++ & Focus is on data display \\
 \hline
 Wax & Very & Somewhat & Cross-platform & Somewhat fast & Good for quick development of small project \\ [1ex]
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Discussion}
TkInter is the standard for Python GUIs. However, it isn't very fast [6] and offers many features that aren't necessary for our needs. 
It also isn't particularly easy to read, which has implications for both testing and maintenance. We need a framework that can accept
 data generated by a machine learning algorithm and then present the data in bracket form. This is, in essence, data visualization. This 
 makes VTK a compelling option. VTK is economical (you can do a lot with a small amount of code), easy to read, very fast, and was developed
 with data visualization in mind [7]. Wax is the least compelling option. It is difficult to read, only somewhat fast, and appears to be in many ways flawed. 
 [8] suggests that Wax is a good option if you want to quickly hack something together, but the presentation of the bracket is perhaps the most important part of this 
 project, and as such, it should not be hacked together. We require an elegant solution to this problem and VTK appears to be the tool that will
 be most poised to fit our needs.
\subsubsection{Selection of best option}
VTK is the option that is most likely to give us the results we want. It is designed with data visualization in mind, which is what we need it for. The other two frameworks are flawed.

\subsection{Technology 4: Where the data will come from}
% needed in second column of first page if using \IEEEpubid
%\IEEEpubidadjcol

\subsubsection{Options 1, 2, and 3}
Ncaa.com, sports-reference.com, and kenpom.com 
\subsubsection{Goals for use in design}
The Goal is to determine where to get the statistics from that can provide an easy way to take the data off the website as well as have all the necessary statistical categories were looking for.

\subsubsection{Criteria being evaluated}
Cost is a factor because there are websites such as kenpom that offer advanced statistics for mens ncaa basketball but you must pay to access the data. Websites such as ncaa.com and sports-reference are free to use and browse the statistics. The amount of stats available is important because the more data points you have to work with the better the machine learning algorithms will do. Kenpom has an advantage in this area, it offers more statistical categories than both ncaa and sports-reference.com. Some websites even offer statistics of where each player on the court was at all times during the game. The ease of use is another important factor both kenpom and sports-reference provide downloadable csv files that can easily be dealt with to put in a database while ncaa.com does not. Correctness of the data is important because the data must be accurate for the machine learning algorithms to do their best. Statistics for both ncaa and sports-reference are backed up by the ncaa or a third party like espn. Kenpom and cites you must pay for your data there is no certainty that the advanced data will be accurate. 

\subsubsection{Table comparing options}


\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{||c | c | c | c | c | c||} 
 \hline
 Website & Cost & Amount & Ease of use & Correctness & Speed \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 NCAA.com & Free & All normal statistics & Need to write script to get data & Confirmed & Slow \\ 
 \hline
 Sports-reference.com & Free & All normal statistics & Downloadable csv file & Confirmed & Fast \\
 \hline
 Kenpom.com & Costs money & All normal statistics plus more advanced & Downloadable csv file & Not validated & fast \\ [1ex]
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}








\subsubsection{Discussion}
Sports-reference is a great option because it has most of the statistics we will need and it is easy to download and use in the csv files unlike the other free option ncaa.com which has roughly the same statistics but without the easy to use downloadable csv. For ncaa.com we would need to write a piece of code that scrapes statistics that we need from the website to gather the data. But if we did go that route we could scrape all the sites (ex. Espn, yahoo) and compare them against each other to see if they all are correct.  Or we could pay for the data using a site like kenpom.com and possibly get data points we would not get otherwise using the two free options should as player movement and touches.

\subsubsection{Selection of best option}
Sports-reference.com is the best option because it’s free, easy to deal with and has enough data to go on. More data can always be scraped off other free websites. It also provides a deep history of the teams statistics so we could incorporate those data points as well.



\subsection{Technology 5: Storage of the data}
% needed in second column of first page if using \IEEEpubid
%\IEEEpubidadjcol

\subsubsection{Options 1, 2, and 3}
Excel, Python SQLite, and Amazon Aurora
\subsubsection{Goals for use in design}
Goal is to figure out the best database option to use that will be the easiest to integrate with the website and machine learning algorithms.

\subsubsection{Criteria being evaluated}
Cost isn’t a factor is this one because they are all free or offered through OSU. The availability and security of the system aren’t a factor because they are all available and the data in the database is not sensitive so it does not need to be encrypted or protected in any extra fashion. Ease of use is a factor because the database needs to be able to integrate with the website nicely as well as be able to add and delete data easily. Speed won’t be a factor because they all offer around the same speeds.

\subsubsection{Table comparing options}



\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{||c | c | c | c | c||} 
 \hline
 Technology & Cost & Ease of use & Security & Speed \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline\hline
 Excel & Free & Easy & Protected & Fast \\ 
 \hline
 Python SQLite & Free & Easy & Protected & Fast \\
 \hline
 Amazon Aurora & Free & Easy & Protected & fast \\ [1ex]
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}




\subsubsection{Discussion}
They are all viable options to use for this project each do about the same thing except excel and Amazon Aurora would be external from the machine learning python code. Both excel and Amazon Aurora are both nice to use because you can search on your dataset easily. They are all very easy to interact with via python code but Amazon Aurora has the big bonus of having a nice user interface for the database as well as the ability to add data very easily via csv files which are the form most of the statistics would come in. The big downside of SQLite, a database included with Python, is it creates a single file for all data per database. Other databases such as MySQL, Amazon Aurora, and Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server have more complicated persistence schemes while offering additional advanced features that are useful for web application data storage.  
\subsubsection{Selection of best option}
Given that Amazon Aurora has the user interface and it is very csv file friendly I am going to have to choose it for our database storage.

\subsection{Technology 6: Machine Learning Libraries/Platforms to Train the Model}
% needed in second column of first page if using \IEEEpubid
%\IEEEpubidadjcol

\subsubsection{Options 1, 2, and 3}
SciKit, Amazon Machine Learning(AML), Pylearn2. 
\subsubsection{Goals for use in design}
Our Algorithm should be as accurate as possible. It should be highly scalable considering we may have a lot of basketball match data. We also want full control of our algorithm, i.e. have access to the source code if we are using some library in case we may need to modify them for our project.
\subsubsection{Criteria being evaluated}

The cost is definitely one important aspect to be considered in our project. We want to make our model available to most people so they can learn that machine learning is a power tool to use in many areas. Providing access to as many people as possible at a low rate or free is our goal. 
The availability is also considered. Some service may only be available in some countries. We should try to avoid those that are only accessible in a small area. 
Speed is also an important aspect of our algorithm. Making our algorithm efficient really enhance the user experience a lot.
Finally security is something to be considered in the process but not too important since we don’t have private user information. But keep in mind that a major flow in our project could cause danger to the system.
\subsubsection{Table comparing options}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{||c c c c c c||}
\hline
Technology & Economy & Readability & Availability & Speed & Notes \\ [0.5ex]
\hline\hline
SciKit & Extremely & very & Open Source & Very & The most popular ML library \\
\hline
AML & very & very & Open Source & Normal & Easy to start with but hard to modify \\
\hline
Pylearn2 & Extremely & very & Open Source & Very & Popular Library but no longer actively developing \\ [1ex]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Discussion}
All three options are very reliable. Amazon Machine Learning(AML) is a fast developing platform that provides easy Machine Learning model to many customers with different background to start with[9]. The advantage of Amazon Machine Learning model is that it has great GUI that makes the process easier. And according to its introduction, AML is very closed to the purpose of our model. With data training the model, it will give a prediction based on the data. Users can also narrow down the searching areas. But because AML is not open sourced I will first dismiss this option. Our project is likely to modify a lot of algorithm in order to better meet the potentially changing needs. SciKit is currently the most popular open source library on Python and has active developers developing them and fixing bugs[10]. While Pylearn2 is also a famous and a widely used library on Python, there is no developers responsible for developing them. Although Pylearn2 claims that they will continue reviewing pull request on Github, there is no active developer for the project[11].
\subsubsection{Selection of best option}
SciLearn is the best option for the need of our project. It is open-sourced, reliable and has active developers developing it. It is also widely popular which means we will be more likely to get community support.




\subsection{Technology 7:Server for computational power and hosting our database}
% needed in second column of first page if using \IEEEpubid
%\IEEEpubidadjcol

\subsubsection{Options 1, 2, and 3}
Amazon Web Service(AWS), Google Cloud Platform(GCP), Oregon State University Student Engineering Server(OSU Server). 
\subsubsection{Goals for use in design}
Our project is likely to require strong computational power because our prediction model needs to evaluate a large amount of data. And if we want to access our model from different devices and different locations, it is important that we train our model on the cloud. A reliable database server on the cloud is also needed for the users to easily use our model worldwide and cross-platform.
\subsubsection{Criteria being evaluated}
Choosing the server for our project should consider the cost, availability, speed, reliability. All of these factors are extremely important. The reliability is the most important factor of them. Our data is precious and the machine-learning-algorithm-trained model is peculiar. Thus we can suffer any data loss. The speed is important as well. The AlphaGo from DeepMind trains itself by playing GO with itself millions of times every day. With fast speed, our model could be more accurate. Availability is also to be considered. For example, Google Cloud Server is not accessible while OSU server and Amazon Web Service are accessible in China. 

\subsubsection{Table comparing options}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{||c c c c c c||}
\hline
Technology & Economy & Readability & Availability & Speed & Notes \\ [0.5ex]
\hline\hline
AWS & very & very & Worldwide & Very & TA very popular service by Amazon \\
\hline
GCP & very & very & Most Countries & Very & Not Accessible from China \\
\hline
OSU Server & Extremely & Normal & Worldwide & Varies & Speed slows down when off campus \\ [1ex]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Discussion}
		When considering the server we use to host our model and data, it is extremely important to consider the factors mentioned above carefully. OSU Student Engineering Server is functionally complete. You can host Linux project there and OSU also provides database server. It is easy and familiar to use. If we have difficulty, we can directly access to tech support on campus. But it is not very fast outside campus. And OSU engineering server is not very flexible if Windows server is to be used. Also, student usually only have access to MySQL database[12]. Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Service are very similar. They both are hosted by giant companies in the US. The major difference between them when considering starting a new project is that Google is not accessible in China[13].
\subsubsection{Selection of best option}
		Overall, after carefully comparing important aspects of them, I think Amazon Web Service is the most reliable and appropriate solution for our project.


\subsection{Technology 8:Statistics Model to determine the importance of different categories of data}
% needed in second column of first page if using \IEEEpubid
%\IEEEpubidadjcol

\subsubsection{Options 1, 2, and 3}
py-statistics, scipy.stats, Pandas
\subsubsection{Goals for use in design}
	An important aspect of our project is a statistical model to determine the importance of data. With good python library and combination of machine learning training, we will get a pretty good estimate of how these data factors affect our result. Choosing a functional and fast statistical library will make our data analyzing easier and make our prediction more accurate.
\subsubsection{Criteria being evaluated}
The cost are all free for the three libraries. The availability is important to be considered. The speed is important to consider when choosing the libraries. We are going to use the functions a couple times, even likely in a loop that cause higher complexity. So the basic running time of functions in these libraries are important. Security is not too important since we don’t collect sensitive data from user but should be considered for the security and reliability of the system. 

\subsubsection{Table comparing options}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{||c c c c c c||}
\hline
Technology & Economy & Readability & Availability & Speed & Notes \\ [0.5ex]
\hline\hline
py-statistics & Extremely & Extremely & Cross Platform & Not Sure & Official statistics library by Python Foundation \\
\hline
scipy.stats & Extremely & very & Cross Platform & Not Sure & Widely popular and sponsored Open Source Project \\
\hline
Pandas & Extremely & very & Worldwide & Cross Platform & Sponsored Open Source Project \\ [1ex]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Discussion}
Py-statistics is a powerful library developed by python foundation. It is reliable and widely used. Most importantly, Python Foundation will keep updating it to ensure its performance and security[13]. Scipy is a widely used library that may provide some functions that others don't. Scipy also highlights its probability functions which will suit our project for predicting basketball result[14]. Scipy is sponsored open source project by ENTHOUGHT. It is very reliable and popular. Pandas is a Python data analysis Library sponsored by NUMFOCUS. The Pandas library highlights its high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis[15]. It is also very popular, widely used and actively maintained by developers. 
\subsubsection{Selection of best option}
All three libraries are very powerful. Our project will use py-statistics first. But the performance will need to be tested when in developing. The other two options may also be used in different context.

% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure

% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the

% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.

\section{Conclusion}
There are many tools available which can be used to achieve the exact software product we desire. With careful consideration, we have located what we believe to be the correct tools for the job. For developing a graphical user interface which will allow students to easily and accurately interact with the module, we will be using PyGUI to develop our basic interface, Webix to provide the user with instructions on how to use the tool, and VTK to present the machine learned bracket in a way that is visually appealing. For getting the basketball data we will use sports-reference.com because of their downloadable csv files. We will store all the data using Amazon Aurora which offers a nice user interface for us to work with. We will be mainly using SciKit Learn library in Python for our machine learning algorithm. Amazon Web Service is the best choice to host our project on cloud.
